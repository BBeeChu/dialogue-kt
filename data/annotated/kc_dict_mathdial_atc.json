  "Use facts about supplementary, complementary, vertical, and adjacent angles in a multi-step problem to write and solve simple equations for an unknown angle in a figure.": 132,
  "Find all factor pairs for a whole number in the range 1–100. Recognize that a whole number is a multiple of each of its factors. Determine whether a given whole number in the range 1–100 is a multiple of a given one-digit number. Determine whether a given whole number in the range 1–100 is prime or composite.": 133,
  "Create equations in two or more variables to represent relationships between quantities; graph equations on coordinate axes with labels and scales.": 134,
  "Count to 100 by ones and by tens.": 135,
  "Draw a picture graph and a bar graph (with single-unit scale) to represent a data set with up to four categories. Solve simple put together, take-apart, and compare problems  using information presented in a bar graph.": 136,
  "Draw a scaled picture graph and a scaled bar graph to represent a data set with several categories. Solve one- and two-step “how many more” and “how many less” problems using information presented in scaled bar graphs. For example, draw a bar graph in which each square in the bar graph might represent 5 pets.": 137,
  "Make a line plot to display a data set of measurements in fractions of a unit (1/2, 1/4, 1/8). Solve problems involving addition and subtraction of fractions by using information presented in line plots. For example, from a line plot find and interpret the difference in length between the longest and shortest specimens in an insect collection.": 138,
  "Analyze and solve pairs of simultaneous linear equations.": 139,
  "Solve systems of linear equations exactly and approximately (e.g., with graphs), focusing on pairs of linear equations in two variables.": 140,
  "Know and apply the properties of integer exponents to generate equivalent numerical expressions. For example, 3^(2) × 3^(–5) = 3^(–3) = 1/3^(3) = 1/27.": 141,
  "Choose and produce an equivalent form of an expression to reveal and explain properties of the quantity represented by the expression.": 142,
  "Recognize and explain the concepts of conditional probability and independence in everyday language and everyday situations. For example, compare the chance of having lung cancer if you are a smoker with the chance of being a smoker if you have lung cancer.": 143,
  "Understand the conditional probability of A given B as P(A and B)/P(B), and interpret independence of A and B as saying that the conditional probability of A given B is the same as the probability of A, and the conditional probability of B given A is the same as the probability of B.": 144,
  "Construct and interpret two-way frequency tables of data when two categories are associated with each object being classified. Use the two-way table as a sample space to decide if events are independent and to approximate conditional probabilities. For example, collect data from a random sample of students in your school on their favorite subject among math, science, and English. Estimate the probability that a randomly selected student from your school will favor science given that the student is in tenth grade. Do the same for other subjects and compare the results.": 145,
  "Fluently add, subtract, multiply, and divide multi-digit decimals using the standard algorithm for each operation.": 146,
  "Draw (freehand, with ruler and protractor, and with technology) geometric shapes with given conditions. Focus on constructing triangles from three measures of angles or sides, noticing when the conditions determine a unique triangle, more than one triangle, or no triangle.": 147,
  "Use square root and cube root symbols to represent solutions to equations of the form x^(2) = p and x^(3) = p, where p is a positive rational number. Evaluate square roots of small perfect squares and cube roots of small perfect cubes. Know that Ö2 is irrational.": 148
